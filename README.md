WHMCS Container
======

Apparently WHMCS has it's own DI container but we'll keep our own container aside because we don't want to mess things up


### Installation

Add `4ernovm/whmcs-container` as a requirement to composer.json:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "4ernovm/whm-container": "0.2.*"
    }
}
```

Add repository information:

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "git@github.com:4ernovm/whmcs-container.git"
    }
],
```

And then run `composer update`


### Usage

will be here soon
